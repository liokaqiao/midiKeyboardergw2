How to play:  Setup:

2.  Connect the keyboard and power it up.
3.  Run the app compiled from this program.

Playing:

4.  Launch Guildwars 2.  Log in, grab an instrument (harp works best).
5.  Start the instrument, then start playing on your keyboard.  You should hear the same sounds in game.

Other features:
Numeric spinner with the 30:  used to tune the delay between virtual keyboard presses, now does nothing.

The dropdown with notes:  Select the key you're playing in.  This transposes your key into the range of C or A minor. 
  helps to turn down your TV or pc speakers when playing off C
  
  
1034/980:  used to be for the octave manager but turns out anet's animated icons are too slow for it.

Flute:  Check if playing the flute (changes the octave manager)  Flute plays in range from C4 to C6
Bass:  check if playing the bass.  The bass has only 2 octaves.
Flat:  Check if off C and playing a key with flats in it.  This shifts the flats up.  Uncheck for keys with Sharps.
